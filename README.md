# TODO App

This app was built using the MERN stack and TypeScript, following [this tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-todo-app-with-react-typescript-nodejs-and-mongodb/)

This particular branch is configured solely for local development. To set up your local environment, run the `npm run build` command from the **root** directory. The script is already configured to handle the client and server directories.

To start the app and view your work, run the `npm run start` command. Ensure you have installed the necessary modules in both the client and server directories!
