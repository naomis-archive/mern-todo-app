# TODO App

This app was built using the MERN stack and TypeScript, following [this tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-todo-app-with-react-typescript-nodejs-and-mongodb/)

This branch is specifically configured to handle the production instance of the app - the plan is to deploy this app on Heroku, though that is still in the works.
